I come from an information architecture and project management background. <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/fabrizioulisse">I spent 25y in digital agencies</a>, simplifying and humanizing tech complexities. I love wandering with [my gravel bike](https://ciclogravelista.com) and [playing my Strat](https://youtu.be/_505xUKLlAo).  <br>Most importantly, I'm a father.
