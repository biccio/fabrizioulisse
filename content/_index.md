I come from an information architecture and project management background. I spent 25y in digital agencies, simplifying and humanizing tech complexities.

This is me on <a href="https://github.com/biccio">Github</a> and <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/fabrizioulisse">Linkedin</a>. I also love wandering with [my gravel bike](https://ciclogravelista.com), and [playing my Strat](https://youtu.be/_505xUKLlAo). 

Most importantly, I'm a father.
