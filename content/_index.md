I come from an information architecture and project management background. I spent 25y in digital agencies, simplifying and humanizing tech complexities.

I love wandering with [my gravel bike](https://ciclogravelista.com), and [playing my Strat](https://youtu.be/_505xUKLlAo). 

Most importantly, I'm a father.
